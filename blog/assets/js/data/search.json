As I sat in front of my computer, I couldn’t believe my eyes. As I continued to use chatGPT, I was struck by how intuitive and user-friendly it was. I didn’t need to have any prior knowledge or experience with language models to be able to use it effectively. Its user interface was simple and straightforward, making it easy for anyone to start using chatGPT right away.One of the most impressive aspects of chatGPT was its ability to understand and respond to natural language. I could ask it questions in the same way that I would ask a friend, and it would provide detailed and accurate answers. This made it incredibly easy to have a conversation with chatGPT, and I found myself using it more and more as a go-to source for information.I was also impressed by the speed at which chatGPT was able to generate text. I could ask it to generate a paragraph or even an entire essay in a matter of seconds, and the resulting text was always of high quality. This made it an incredibly useful tool for anyone who needs to produce written content quickly and efficiently.Overall, my experience with chatGPT was nothing short of amazing. It was an incredible tool that has the potential to revolutionize the way we access and use information. I can’t wait to see what the future holds for chatGPT and the world of artificial intelligence.In fact ChatGPT wrote this entire blog post.Update: Jan. 05, 2023Hi, the human here. Yes that was a little ingenuine on my part for leading you on like that, I am sorry about that. But it does a great job right?But I really want to talk about this incredible new and exciting tool. For a long time I always had wondered what it would be like to experience a new and life changing product. The biggest game changing product that I remember in my life was the iphone. I was a child then and I vaguely remember it. Even then I could not conceptualize what this product would really was. And for a long time I wished that I could experience this change and to see how life would change forever because of it.Here is a quick list of how long it took modern tech websites to reach 1 million active daily users:Airbnb: 30 monthsTwitter: 24 monthsFacebook: 10 monthsDropbox: 7 monthsSpotify: 5 monthsInstagram: 2.5 monthsChatGPT: 5 daysThe craziest part is all of my interactions about this product were ONLY communicated by talking to other people. No social media campaigns. No podcast shoutouts. No finding on twitter. Just from friends and seeing people use it. 5 days" }, { "title": "My Hello World", "url": "/blog/posts/First-Blog/", "categories": "", "tags": "", "date": "2022-11-27 22:05:00 +0000", "snippet": "Does it ever start without a Hello World?", "content": "Does it ever start without a Hello World?" } ]
